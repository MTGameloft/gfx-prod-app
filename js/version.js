   version.js — the build marker.

   GitHub Pages serves the app's files with `cache-control: max-age=600`, so a
   tab can be running code up to ten minutes old and an ordinary refresh will
   still hand back the cached copy. Inside Teams there is no address bar and no
   obvious way to tell.

   So the build is stamped here, shown in Settings -> About, and checked
   against the server on demand with a cache-busting fetch. That turns "is my
   Teams app up to date?" from something you have to take on trust into a
   button.

   BUMP THIS whenever you deploy something you need to be able to confirm
   arrived.

export const BUILD_NOTES = 'Edits now go back to Jira. Change a mirrored issue here — its status, summary, estimate, assignee, dates, priority or labels — and Settings → Jira mirror lists exactly which fields will be sent, per issue, old value beside new. What travels is a diff, never a snapshot, so a colleague’s edit in Jira since your last pull is not quietly overwritten. Status is not sent as a field: Jira moves an issue by workflow transition, so the helper reads which transitions the issue actually allows and reports the refusal, with the list of permitted moves, rather than claiming a success it did not get. Nothing leaves the machine until you press the button and confirm.';
