   version.js — the build marker.

   GitHub Pages serves the app's files with `cache-control: max-age=600`, so a
   tab can be running code up to ten minutes old and an ordinary refresh will
   still hand back the cached copy. Inside Teams there is no address bar and no
   obvious way to tell.

   So the build is stamped here, shown in Settings -> About, and checked
   against the server on demand with a cache-busting fetch. That turns "is my
   Teams app up to date?" from something you have to take on trust into a
   button.

   BUMP THIS whenever you deploy something you need to be able to confirm
   arrived.

The board groups by Status, Sprint, Epic, Assignee or Component, and the list indents sub-tasks under their parent.
